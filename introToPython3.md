# Making Friends With Python 3

## Intro

This lesson is targeted at Software Carpentry instructors looking to make the jump from Python 2 to 3 both in their teaching, and in their personal practice. We're hoping to deliver this as a live session at the [Software and Data Carpentry Instructor and Helper Retreat](http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-retreat-2015/) on November 14, 2015, and preserve this lesson for future async use by the community. This lesson is just an outline at the moment; pull requests with more ideas and more fleshed out content very welcome, or join the dicussion in [this issue](https://github.com/swcarpentry/instructor-retreat-2015/issues/28).
