# Making Friends With Python 3

As part of the 2015 [Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Instructor and
Helper Retreat](http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-retreat-2015/),
we want to explore our change from teaching Python2 to teaching Python3.
There are a number of aspects of this. We'll have a global broadcast
session by Dave Jones at 10:00 UTC on "What to watch when transitioning from
Python 2 to Python 3". But then we want instructors who are happy teaching
Python 2 to think about what they need to know or change to teach Python3.
The list shouldn't be very long!

In particular, we would like to find answers to questions like:

 * What are the syntactic and structural changes I'm going to need to know 
   about when changing from 2 to 3?
 * Where do I go to find out the gory details / remind myself of the changes?
 * What (if anything) should I expect to see change amongst a group of
   learners being taught python3 compared to python2. For example, are there
   new common errors, misunderstandings etc.?
 * How do I install python3 (or rather, how do I add python3 alongside a 
   python2 anaconda install. A new installation is covered in the instructions
   in the workshop template)?
 * Can I also use what I learn to start to move some of my own work over to 
   python3?

It would be nice if one of the outcomes of the retreat was a study guide to
help instructors and helpers make the change evenn if they don't make it to 
the retreat. With this in mind, we hope to develop a short set of notes, 
covering the answers to questions like those above. These notes will live
in this repository.
